lamus2-1.3.0

    Additions:
        - SESSIONS FOLDER: Added support for the "sessions" folder, where files
          can be copied to in order to have them automatically upload to a
          new workspace under the corresponding top node.

    Fixes:
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: Fixed issue with documents without self-handle.

lamus2-1.2.0 (2015-01-29)

    Additions:
        - REMOVE UNLINKED NODES: Added the option of removing all or the selected
          unlinked nodes from the unlinked nodes table.
        - TOP NODE ACTIONS: Restricted the possible actions on the top node.
        - MULTIPLE NODES ACTIONS: When multiple nodes are selected, it is now
          possible to delete or unlink them (unless one of the selected nodes
          is the top node of the workspace, in which case no actions are allowed).
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: If there are external handles included in uploaded
          files, they are now dealt with accordingly.

    Changes:
        - CS2: Updated the version of the CS2 libraries.
        - OPEN WORKSPACES: If the user has no open workspaces, the list shown
          when "Select Workspace" is clicked becomes invisible and a message
          directs the user to the "Create Workspace" option.
    Fixes:
        - INDICATING BUTTONS: Fixed some issues with the ajax indicating buttons,
          including the confirmation dialogs, which had to be done in a different
          way for the ajax version of the buttons, and also the update of the
          feedback panel.
        - UI AJAX: Fixed several issues regarding the UI, like clicking of buttons
          in succession or refreshing different panels after some click.
        - PERMISSION ADJUSTER: Fixed issue with files which were uploaded and
          deleted in the same workspace (never having an archive URL and causing
          problems when adjusting permissions).
