lamus2-1.6.1 (2016-09-23)

    Changes:
        - Introduced CMDI validation upon submission in the archive.
        - Added metadata validation feedback to the UI, for "create" and "submit" workspace actions.
        - Creating mandatory children (from profile schema) when linking/unlinking nodes in the UI.
        - Added support for directory names which are different from their respective node names.
        - Added optional multi-line label for information text to the generic confirmation popup.
        - Added support to provide workspace files via a manual symbolic link.
        - Block the creation of workspaces in top nodes that are part of multiple vpaths.
        - Update handle for deleted files (instead of deleting it).
        - When metadata files are supplied via the orphans folder, link/unlink workspace nodes by editing their copies rather than the original files.
        - Added UI feedback when a metadata reference is automatically removed because it has no matching proxy.
        - Trigger AMS2 recalculation on nodes' canonical vpaths when workspace contains children with multiple vpaths.

    Fixes:
        - Extraction of windows generated .zip files.
        - Problems finding corresponding workspace nodes for file references in certain conditions.
        - Handle exception when trying to delete a nonexistent handle.
        - Cleanup of orphans' directory supplied files.
        - Fall back when atomic move fails.
        - Problems with metadata API swapping the order of the elements thus generating invalid CMDI.
        - NPE thrown when moving existing archive resources between sessions on the same workspace.
        - NPE when trying to update references in the parent.
        - Directory naming for workspaces containing partially archived branches.
        - Vertical scrollbar missing in workspace management page.
        - 'Page not found' error after logout from the workspaces' management page.
        - Exception when trying to delete workspaces which failed during initialization.
          
lamus2-1.6.0 (2016-02-26)

    Changes:
        - MANAGEMENT CONSOLE: Adjusted the columns for which sorting and filtering
          is available (#4158).
        - TYPECHECKER CONFIGURATION: Moved the special typechecker configuration
          to the tomcat context. This allows the configuration of some folders
          to accept files considered ARCHIVABLE_SHORTTERM (#4852).
        - SCHEMATRON: Separated the display of errors and warnings in the CMDI
          schematron validation, so that the actual errors are more clearly visible.
        - SAVE METADATA: During the workspace import, instead of saving the parent
          file each time a reference was changed, now this is done only once per
          child, improving the performance of the import (#4858).
        - CIRCULAR LINKS UPLOAD: Added prevention against uploading trees with
          a link to the top node of the workspace or one of its ancestors in
          the archive (#4839).

    Fixes:
        - PRE-LOCK: Fixed an issue with the pre-lock of the top node of the
          workspace, in case that node is already pre-locked.

lamus2-1.6.0-RC1 (2016-02-12)

    Additions:
        - MANAGEMENT CONSOLE: Added sorting and filtering in the management console,
          as well as a button to re-crawl a stuck workspace (#4158).

    Changes:
        - SCHEMATRON: Started using an XSLT file, based on the original schematron,
          for the schematron validation (#4801).
        - SCHEMA VALIDATION: Replaced the call to the validation provided by the
          Metadata API by a call to the CMDIValidator class, from the
          cmdi-validator-core dependency (#4835).

lamus2-1.5.0-RC4 (2016-02-05)

    Fixes:
        - UNLINKED NODES: Now updating the archive URL of unlinked nodes, since
          later on they can cause clashes with newly inserted nodes, which
          ultimately would cause inconsistencies (#4842).

lamus2-1.5.0-RC3 (2016-02-02)

    Changes:
        - PRE-LOCKS: Added the concept of pre-locks, in order to prevent
          simultaneous attempts of creating workspaces in the same branch (#4814).

    Fixes:
        - LINK MATCHING: During upload, there were some situations in which the
          child node matched to a specific link was not correct, leading to
          other issues later on (#4834).
        - DELETED URL: Now updating also the URL for deleted nodes in the
          corpusstructure DB, which was preventing potential new nodes from being
          moved to the location where those nodes used to be (#4817).
        - TREE REPLACE: When the handle in the old tree and new tree are not
          equivalent, the old tree is simply deleted instead of replaced,
          since there is no relation between the two.


lamus2-1.5.0-RC2 (2016-01-27)

    Changes:
        - SPECIAL CHARACTERS: Now rejecting uploads containing special characters
          in the filename (#4798).
        - CORPUS STRUCTURE: Updated the corpus structure libraries.

    Fixes:
        - DEPENDENCIES: Excluded some redundant dependencies (#4807).
        - SCHEMATRON: Fixed the schematron files in order to prevent a parsing error
          which was causing validation problems (#4780).
        - MANAGEMENT CONSOLE: Fixed some issues with the management console (#4812).
        - RELATIVE PATH: Fixed issues with the retrieval of the relative path between
          parent and child in case the parent has a new version (#4816).
        - WORKSPACE CREATION: Issues during the workspace creation were being
          caused by the fact that some fields were not up-to-date (#4818).
        - BUTTON MODEL: In some cases the button model was not being refreshed
          after the action (link, for instance) was performed (#4800).
        - CRAWLER ID: Some workspaces were having trouble getting back the crawler ID
          because the workspace variable in the exporter was shared by different
          workspaces, leading to inconsistencies (#4821).

lamus2-1.5.0-RC1 (2015-12-30)

    Changes:
        - HANDLE-UTILS: Updated version of the handle-utils library.
        - SCHEMATRON: Updated version of the schematron library.

    Fixes:
        - MANAGEMENT TABLE: Fixed the issue with the workspace management table,
          in which different pages would display the same workspaces (#4781).
        - DELETE UPLOADED NODE: Fixed the issue with deleting uploaded nodes after
          linked in the tree (the references wouldn't be removed from the parent) (#4802).
        - FEEDBACK PANEL: Fixed the issue with the feedback panel not displaying the
          correct message after the workspace submission (#4799).
        - LINK BUTTON: Fixed the issue with the link button. After pressing it,
          the selected unlinked node was not being cleared, so every time it was
          pressed after that an error message would be displayed (#4800).


lamus2-1.4.1-RC1 (2015-12-01)

    Fixes:
        - "_2" SUFFIXES: Prevented unnecessary addition of "_2" suffixes
          after node replacements. (#4757)

        - REPLACED NODES URL: Added a call to the corpusstructure service which
          updates the URL of nodes that have been replaced,
          before calling the crawler. (#4792)

lamus2-1.4.0-RC4 (2015-11-06)

    Changes:
        - UPDATED DEPENDENCIES: Updated the versions of the
          AMS2 and typechecker jars.
        - ANNOT-TOOLS: Added the annot-tools jar, which is used by the
          typechecker to parse EAF files.

    Fixes:
        - REMOVE COMPONENT: When unlinking a node, its corresponding component
          is removed from the parent, besides the resource proxy (#4613, #4763).
        - REMOVE ALL UNLINKED: The "Remove All" option in the unlinked nodes
          panel has been fixed (#4765).

lamus2-1.4.0-RC3 (2015-10-23)

    Changes:
        - COMPONENTS: Added the mapping between node types and components, for
          the case of external nodes, for which the typechecker is not executed. (#4613)

    Fixes:
        - LOCALURI UPDATE: Now always updating 'localURI' during upload
          (except for external files) in order to prevent issues when trying to
          retrieve the reference using that attribute (#4751, #4753, #4754, #4756).
        - UNLINKING REPLACED PARENT: After replacing a file, if its children
          weren't changed (and still pointing to some workspace nodes),
          they are unlinked, so that only the new parent has that connection (#4755, #4358).
        - REPLACE EXPORTER: Changed the logic that determines which exporter to
          use for what node. The replaced nodes were being handed, wrongly, to
          the unlinked nodes exporter.

lamus2-1.4.0-RC2 (2015-09-28)

    Fixes:
        - FOLDER NAMES: Fix for the problems with folder name for the top node,
          in cases when this was defined by a human (replacing a strange character
          by a similarly looking one doesn't work the same way for Lamus2).

lamus2-1.4.0-RC1 (2015-09-21)

    Changes:
        - METADATA PROFILES: The profile validation configuration has now more
          complete information and missing profiles are now included.
        - ACTIVITY INDICATOR: Changed the activity indicator (TLA logo) and
          disabled the indicators in most buttons, since they became redundant (#4701).
        - OPEN WORKSPACES: Improved the information displayed in the list of
          currently open workspaces (#4720).
        - NODE LOCKS: Changed the logic behind the node locks and the way they
          are locked/unlocked (#4723).

    Fixes:
        - UPLOAD COUNT: Since a previous addition, the successful/failed upload
          count was coming from different sources, resulting in inconsistencies.
          This has been fixed (#4612).
        - FOLDER NAMES: Corpora with strange characters were normalised regarding
          the names of the resulting created folders (#4721).
        - RELATIVE PATH: Uploading nodes with relative references (starting with
          "./" or "../") were not being properly handled. This was fixed.
        

lamus2-1.3.0-RC4 (2015-09-01)

    Changes:
        - HANDLE-UTILS: Updated the handle-utils library.

    Fixes:
        - DUPLICATE UPLOADS: Some fixes in the way uploaded files are handled,
          mostly regarding the upload of repeated files (#4612).
        - FOLDER STRUCTURE: The folder structure created for deeper branches of
          the tree wasn't being done properly. That has been fixed (#4709).
        - NODE NAMES: The names displayed in the nodes weren't always correct
          (sometimes the filename was being used instead
          of the name in the CMDI document).
        - ORPHANS DIRECTORY: When the orphans directory didn't exist, an
          exception was being thrown, preventing the workspace from being created.

lamus2-1.3.0-RC3 (2015-08-20)

    Additions:
        - INFO FILES: Info files are now supported: they're recognized when
          already present in files (import or upload) and it's also possible
          to link files as info files within the workspace
          (for 'lat-corpus' and 'lat-session' profiles) (#4655).
        - HANDLE NORMALIZATION: Whenever files are imported, uploaded or exported,
          the handles are normalized in order to have consistency in the database
          and also prevent issues when searching the files using handles (#4705).
        - ACTIVITY INDICATOR: Added an activity indicator (#4701).

    Changes:
        - MANAGEMENT CONSOLE: Some changes, mostly cosmetic, in the management
          console (#4158).
        - SUBMISSION MESSAGE: Added some more information to the submission
          email messages (#4155).

    Fixes:
        - COMPONENT REFERENCES: Fixed the way references are added to components,
          within the CMDI files (#4613).
        - FEEDBACK PANEL REFRESH: Fixed the situations when the feedback panel
          wasn't being properly updated, showing an old message (#3633).

lamus2-1.3.0-RC2 (2015-06-22)

    Additions:
        - RESOURCE TYPE Support for different ResourceType values for resource
          proxies ("LandingPage", "SearchPage" and "SearchService").

    Changes:
        - FOLDER STRUCTURE: Changed the supported folder structure back to the
          old one (used in the old Lamus), with the folders "Corpusstructure",
          "Metadata", "sessions", "Annotations", "Media" and "Info".

lamus2-1.3.0-RC1 (2015-05-15)

    Additions:
        - SESSIONS FOLDER: Added support for the "sessions" folder, where files
          can be copied to in order to have them automatically upload to a
          new workspace under the corresponding top node.
        - METADATA VALIDATION: Added schematron validation in two stages. One,
          less strict, during upload, and another one during the submission.
          This includes the restriction of metadata files to a limited set of
          allowed profiles.
        - DISALLOWED NAMES: Implemented the necessary restrictions for folder
          names which should not be allowed in the backups.
        - ICONS: A more complete set of tree icons has been added, based on the
          existing one in the metadata browser.

    Changes:
        - REPLACE TOP NODE: Now it is possible to perform the replacement of the
          top node of the workspace.

    Fixes:
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: Fixed issue with documents without self-handle.
        - LAYOUT: Several changes in the layout. The feedback panel has been
          adjusted and several bugs in UI components have been fixed.
        - USERNAME REFRESH: The username label on the top of the page now gets
          refreshed properly (in almost all cases). A login intermediate page
          is now used.
        - EXTERNAL NODE NAME: Fixed the issue with adding external nodes without
          a filename.
        - REF ATTRIBUTE: The "ref" attribute was missing from the node linking
          operation. This has been fixed.

lamus2-1.2.0 (2015-01-29)

    Additions:
        - REMOVE UNLINKED NODES: Added the option of removing all or the selected
          unlinked nodes from the unlinked nodes table.
        - TOP NODE ACTIONS: Restricted the possible actions on the top node.
        - MULTIPLE NODES ACTIONS: When multiple nodes are selected, it is now
          possible to delete or unlink them (unless one of the selected nodes
          is the top node of the workspace, in which case no actions are allowed).
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: If there are external handles included in uploaded
          files, they are now dealt with accordingly.

    Changes:
        - CS2: Updated the version of the CS2 libraries.
        - OPEN WORKSPACES: If the user has no open workspaces, the list shown
          when "Select Workspace" is clicked becomes invisible and a message
          directs the user to the "Create Workspace" option.
    Fixes:
        - INDICATING BUTTONS: Fixed some issues with the ajax indicating buttons,
          including the confirmation dialogs, which had to be done in a different
          way for the ajax version of the buttons, and also the update of the
          feedback panel.
        - UI AJAX: Fixed several issues regarding the UI, like clicking of buttons
          in succession or refreshing different panels after some click.
        - PERMISSION ADJUSTER: Fixed issue with files which were uploaded and
          deleted in the same workspace (never having an archive URL and causing
          problems when adjusting permissions).

lamus2-1.1.0 (2014-12-12)

    First release adapted for the CMDI / hybrid archive.

lamus2-1.1-SNAPSHOT (2014-09-24)

    Changes:
        - DELETE WORKSPACE: In the management console, the manager is now able
          to delete workspaces without being their owner.

lamus2-1.0 (2014-08-20)

    First release
