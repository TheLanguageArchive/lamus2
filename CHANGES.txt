lamus2-1.4.0-RC1 (2015-09-21)

    Changes:
        - METADATA PROFILES: The profile validation configuration has now more
          complete information and missing profiles are now included.
        - ACTIVITY INDICATOR: Changed the activity indicator (TLA logo) and
          disabled the indicators in most buttons, since they became redundant (#4701).
        - OPEN WORKSPACES: Improved the information displayed in the list of
          currently open workspaces (#4720).
        - NODE LOCKS: Changed the logic behind the node locks and the way they
          are locked/unlocked (#4723).

    Fixes:
        - UPLOAD COUNT: Since a previous addition, the successful/failed upload
          count was coming from different sources, resulting in inconsistencies.
          This has been fixed (#4612).
        - FOLDER NAMES: Corpora with strange characters were normalised regarding
          the names of the resulting created folders (#4721).
        - RELATIVE PATH: Uploading nodes with relative references (starting with
          "./" or "../") were not being properly handled. This was fixed.
        

lamus2-1.3.0-RC4 (2015-09-01)

    Changes:
        - HANDLE-UTILS: Updated the handle-utils library.

    Fixes:
        - DUPLICATE UPLOADS: Some fixes in the way uploaded files are handled,
          mostly regarding the upload of repeated files (#4612).
        - FOLDER STRUCTURE: The folder structure created for deeper branches of
          the tree wasn't being done properly. That has been fixed (#4709).
        - NODE NAMES: The names displayed in the nodes weren't always correct
          (sometimes the filename was being used instead
          of the name in the CMDI document).
        - ORPHANS DIRECTORY: When the orphans directory didn't exist, an
          exception was being thrown, preventing the workspace from being created.

lamus2-1.3.0-RC3 (2015-08-20)

    Additions:
        - INFO FILES: Info files are now supported: they're recognized when
          already present in files (import or upload) and it's also possible
          to link files as info files within the workspace
          (for 'lat-corpus' and 'lat-session' profiles) (#4655).
        - HANDLE NORMALIZATION: Whenever files are imported, uploaded or exported,
          the handles are normalized in order to have consistency in the database
          and also prevent issues when searching the files using handles (#4705).
        - ACTIVITY INDICATOR: Added an activity indicator (#4701).

    Changes:
        - MANAGEMENT CONSOLE: Some changes, mostly cosmetic, in the management
          console (#4158).
        - SUBMISSION MESSAGE: Added some more information to the submission
          email messages (#4155).

    Fixes:
        - COMPONENT REFERENCES: Fixed the way references are added to components,
          within the CMDI files (#4613).
        - FEEDBACK PANEL REFRESH: Fixed the situations when the feedback panel
          wasn't being properly updated, showing an old message (#3633).

lamus2-1.3.0-RC2 (2015-06-22)

    Additions:
        - RESOURCE TYPE Support for different ResourceType values for resource
          proxies ("LandingPage", "SearchPage" and "SearchService").

    Changes:
        - FOLDER STRUCTURE: Changed the supported folder structure back to the
          old one (used in the old Lamus), with the folders "Corpusstructure",
          "Metadata", "sessions", "Annotations", "Media" and "Info".

lamus2-1.3.0-RC1 (2015-05-15)

    Additions:
        - SESSIONS FOLDER: Added support for the "sessions" folder, where files
          can be copied to in order to have them automatically upload to a
          new workspace under the corresponding top node.
        - METADATA VALIDATION: Added schematron validation in two stages. One,
          less strict, during upload, and another one during the submission.
          This includes the restriction of metadata files to a limited set of
          allowed profiles.
        - DISALLOWED NAMES: Implemented the necessary restrictions for folder
          names which should not be allowed in the backups.
        - ICONS: A more complete set of tree icons has been added, based on the
          existing one in the metadata browser.

    Changes:
        - REPLACE TOP NODE: Now it is possible to perform the replacement of the
          top node of the workspace.

    Fixes:
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: Fixed issue with documents without self-handle.
        - LAYOUT: Several changes in the layout. The feedback panel has been
          adjusted and several bugs in UI components have been fixed.
        - USERNAME REFRESH: The username label on the top of the page now gets
          refreshed properly (in almost all cases). A login intermediate page
          is now used.
        - EXTERNAL NODE NAME: Fixed the issue with adding external nodes without
          a filename.
        - REF ATTRIBUTE: The "ref" attribute was missing from the node linking
          operation. This has been fixed.

lamus2-1.2.0 (2015-01-29)

    Additions:
        - REMOVE UNLINKED NODES: Added the option of removing all or the selected
          unlinked nodes from the unlinked nodes table.
        - TOP NODE ACTIONS: Restricted the possible actions on the top node.
        - MULTIPLE NODES ACTIONS: When multiple nodes are selected, it is now
          possible to delete or unlink them (unless one of the selected nodes
          is the top node of the workspace, in which case no actions are allowed).
        - EXTERNAL HANDLES: If there are external handles included in uploaded
          files, they are now dealt with accordingly.

    Changes:
        - CS2: Updated the version of the CS2 libraries.
        - OPEN WORKSPACES: If the user has no open workspaces, the list shown
          when "Select Workspace" is clicked becomes invisible and a message
          directs the user to the "Create Workspace" option.
    Fixes:
        - INDICATING BUTTONS: Fixed some issues with the ajax indicating buttons,
          including the confirmation dialogs, which had to be done in a different
          way for the ajax version of the buttons, and also the update of the
          feedback panel.
        - UI AJAX: Fixed several issues regarding the UI, like clicking of buttons
          in succession or refreshing different panels after some click.
        - PERMISSION ADJUSTER: Fixed issue with files which were uploaded and
          deleted in the same workspace (never having an archive URL and causing
          problems when adjusting permissions).
