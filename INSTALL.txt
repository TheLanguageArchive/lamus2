LAMUS2 INSTALLATION

    SOURCES

The LAMUS2 source code contains 3 modules: a jar package with most of the functionality,
the main war which contains the web interface and a tar.gz archive that packs
the war file (therefore it contains both modules, since the war contains the jar).
It can be built using maven.

To create all the artifacts for LAMUS2:
  mvn package -DdeployTo=<name of the server where it will be deployed to>

In order to, besides creating the artifacts, also install them into the local repository:
  mvn install -DdeployTo=<name of the server where it will be deployed to>
  
The "deployTo" property should contain the name of the server where the war file is
supposed to be deployed. The shibboleth configuration file (shhaa.xml) will be filtered
accordingly (using a filter file with the corresponding name: "application.<server>.properties",
under the directory "./src/main/filters").


    COMPILED PACKAGE

The war file (can be extracted from the tar.gz package) should be unpacked into
the folder where the current version is usually located
(i.e. in lux17, it would be "/lat/webapps/lamus2"). If the code was compiled for the server
in question, no files need to be changed. If not, the configuration files (e.g. shhaa.xml)
should be adapted.

The files extracted from the war file need to be readable for the UID in which the tomcat is running.


    CONFIGURATION
Example configuration and some explanations can be found in the file named CONFIGURATION.
