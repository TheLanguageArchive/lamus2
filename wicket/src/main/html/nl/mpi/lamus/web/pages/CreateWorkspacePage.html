			the topnode of your new workspace. Select the desired node and use the right mouse button to open
			the pop-up menu, then choose the option <b>Select this node</b> to use the node as top-node for a new
			workspace</p>
		    <p>Once you have selected a node, this node and the subcorpus it represents (all its descendant nodes)
			will be copied into the new workspace, where you can then modify and extend the subcorpus
